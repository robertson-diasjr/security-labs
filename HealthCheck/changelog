Version 1.2
Date: 20140423
Changed by: robertson.diasjr@gmail.com

Details:

	Added the following checks in exec-hc-cisco-fw.sh and in default template:

	1. XAUTH CHECKING: the script verify if there are IPSec VPN client configured on
	device. If there are no VPN Client configured on device, XAuth check is not required
	so the script returns PASS. If there are any VPN client, it performs XAuth check.
	If XAuth is disabled then returns FAILED else, if XAuth if enabled (the default 
	configuration on Cisco ASA firewall) the script returns a WARNING regarding 
	password requirements and VPN authentication parameters. Added SECTION_XAUTH in
	default template file. Further steps are checking for AnyConnect and EZVPN features.

	2. FLOODGUARD CHECKING: this checks only applies for PIX devices since floodguard 
	configuration is deprecated in ASA, it is enabled by default and cannot be modified. 
	Therefore it returns PASS if is an ASA, else it verifies wheather the PIX floodguard
	configuration is enable or not. Even if the floodguard check is OK for PIX, the script
	returns a WARNING, since PIX is a out of service model. Added SECTION_FLOODGUARD in
	default template file.

	3. AAA SERVER DEPLETION MODE: since Cisco ASA 7.0(1) the default value for this configuration
	is 10 minutes of deadtime, but the default configuration is not shown on running-config output.
	So the script checks the deadtime configured for reactivation of AAA depletion on device and
	compares with the value on template. Returning PASS or FAILED regarding on the policy requirements
	inserted in template file. SECTION_DEADTIME added.

	4. SNMP COMMUNITY CHECKING BY TEMPLATE: the SNMP community requirements are inputed directly
	in template file. Edit the script code is no longer necessary.

	5. WARNINGS: included warnings where extras checks are required. Add the results 
	in final check and summary.

	ALSO: 
	- It has been made some minor changes on exec-hc-cisco-sw.sh script in order to make it usable
	on AP devices
	- Added several customers templates
